# About Me

I’m Phin3has, a seasoned Security Engineering professional with over 15 years of experience in cybersecurity, specializing in cloud infrastructure, DevSecOps, and risk management. My journey into tech began with a fascination for computers, sparked by the challenges of securing complex systems. Over the years, I’ve cultivated a passion for building resilient, scalable solutions that enable innovation without sacrificing security. Whether it’s designing disaster-resilient data platforms or streamlining AWS access to improve security posture, I thrive at the crossroads of strategy and execution.

My love for problem-solving extends beyond my day job. I created this blog to document my ongoing adventures in cloud security, infrastructure hardening, and tooling optimization. It’s a space where I share the lessons I’ve learned, the mistakes I’ve made, and the solutions I’ve developed. Writing allows me to clarify my thinking, connect with others in the field, and hopefully inspire a new wave of engineers who share my love for protecting the systems that power our lives.

When I’m not immersed in all things cybersecurity, I’m exploring the great outdoors with my family, cheering on my favorite sports teams, or hunting for the world’s greatest cheeseburger (recommendations welcome). This blog is as much about my professional growth as it is about celebrating the joy of learning and the connections we make along the way. Dive in and join me on this journey!
